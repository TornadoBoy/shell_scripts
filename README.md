# shell_scripts
Various handy bash scripts I use for setting machines up

`get_latest_anaconda.sh`  
Fetches the latest build of Anaconda3, installs it (without user prompts), adds it to bashrc, reloads the shell, and cleans up after itself.  
Basically takes you from a fresh system to one with Python/Anaconda setup and ready to use.
